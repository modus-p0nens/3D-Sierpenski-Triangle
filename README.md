This is a quick post. Some recent thoughts about the chaos game in an old Numberphile video inspired this. In the video, Brady and Ben Sparks play a game based off of dice rolls. Ben draws 3 points equidistant from each such to form the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Then he draws a point anywhere in between these points as a starting point for the game. The rest of the game is a simple iterative process. Ben rolls the dice, and depending on the outcome he moves halfway to one of the vertices. After many iterations of this process, scarily enough, Sierpinski’s Triangle pops out! It’s honestly kind of creepy that random dice rolls form this thing. Regardless, it got me thinking. It might be obvious to others, but I was curious as to whether a Sierpinski-like pyramid would form if we played the game in 3 dimensions by adding an additional vertex and so I quickly programmed it in Python and sure enough!

(I am currently trying to animate it so that it rotates, but I am having trouble so stay posted!)
